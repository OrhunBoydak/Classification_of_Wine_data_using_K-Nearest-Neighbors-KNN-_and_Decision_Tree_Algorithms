# Classification of Wine Dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree Algorithms

This project demonstrates the application of two classification algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree—on the Wine dataset. The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in classifying different types of wine based on their chemical properties.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Wine dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html) from the scikit-learn library. It contains 178 samples of wine with 13 features each, representing various chemical properties.

## Objectives

- Apply K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.
- Apply Decision Tree algorithm for classification.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of both algorithms.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
